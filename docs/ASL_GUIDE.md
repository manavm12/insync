# ASL (American Sign Language) Interpreter Guide

## Overview

This real-time ASL interpreter is designed to help hearing-impaired individuals communicate effectively by recognizing American Sign Language gestures and converting them to text keywords. The system uses computer vision and hand landmark detection to identify ASL signs in real-time.

## Current Capabilities

### ✅ Fully Supported (Static Hand Shapes)

The system currently recognizes **40+ ASL signs** based on static hand shapes:

#### Numbers (0-10)

- **0**: Closed fist forming 'O' shape
- **1**: Index finger pointing up (also Letter D)
- **2**: Index + middle fingers in V-shape (also Letter V)
- **3**: Index + middle + ring fingers extended (also Letter W)
- **4**: Four fingers spread, thumb tucked
- **5**: All five fingers spread open
- **10**: Thumbs up gesture (also means "Good")

#### ASL Alphabet (Static Letters)

- **A**: Closed fist with thumb on the side
- **B**: Four fingers together, thumb tucked
- **C**: Curved hand shape
- **D**: Index finger up (same as Number 1)
- **F**: Thumb and index forming a circle
- **I**: Only pinky finger extended
- **K**: Index and middle fingers at angle
- **L**: Thumb and index at 90-degree angle (L-shape)
- **N**: Index and middle fingers close together
- **S**: Closed fist with thumb across fingers
- **U**: Index and middle close together, pointing up
- **V**: Index and middle spread apart (Peace sign, Number 2)
- **W**: Three middle fingers extended (Number 3)
- **Y**: Thumb and pinky extended (Hang loose)

#### Common Words & Phrases

- **HELLO / HI**: Open palm raised near forehead, palm facing out
- **STOP**: Open palm facing forward
- **WAIT**: Open palm facing forward
- **I LOVE YOU**: Thumb + index + pinky extended, palm out
- **GOOD**: Thumbs up (Number 10)
- **OK**: Thumb and index forming circle (Letter F)

### 🔄 Partially Supported (Hand Shape Detected, Motion Needed)

These signs are recognized by hand shape, but full interpretation requires motion tracking:

#### Greetings & Politeness

- **THANK YOU**: Open palm near lips (needs forward motion from lips)
- **PLEASE**: Open palm on chest (needs circular motion)
- **SORRY**: Fist on chest (needs circular rubbing motion)
- **GOODBYE**: Open hand (needs waving motion)

#### Questions & Responses

- **YES**: Fist (needs nodding motion)
- **NO**: Three fingers (needs closing motion)

#### Everyday Needs

- **HELP**: Fist on palm (needs lifting motion together)
- **EAT**: Fingertips together (needs motion to mouth)
- **DRINK**: C-shaped hand (needs motion to mouth)
- **WATER**: W-sign (needs tapping motion at chin)
- **BATHROOM**: T-sign (needs shaking motion)
- **MORE**: Fingertips together (needs tapping motion)
- **WANT**: Open palms (needs pulling toward body)
- **NEED**: Downward motion required
- **GO**: Pointing (needs forward motion)
- **COME**: Pointing (needs inward motion)

#### Emotions

- **HAPPY**: Hands on chest (needs upward brushing motion)
- **SAD**: Hands near face (needs downward motion)
- **ANGRY**: Claw shape (needs pulling away from face)
- **EXCITED**: Hands on chest (needs alternating circular motion)

## How to Use

### Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/insync

# Run the ASL interpreter
python main.py
```

### Using the Real-Time ASL Interpreter

```python
from src.hand_landmarks import RealTimeGestureDetector

# Initialize the ASL detector
detector = RealTimeGestureDetector(camera_id=0)

# Start real-time ASL detection
detector.start_detection(
    show_video=True,
    print_landmarks=False,
    save_to_file=False
)
```

### Interactive Controls

While the ASL interpreter is running:

- **'q'**: Quit the application
- **'s'**: Save current hand landmarks to file
- **'p'**: Toggle landmark printing on/off
- **SPACE**: Show detailed analysis of current gesture

### Reading Gesture Output

The system displays detected gestures with the `ASL:` prefix:

- `ASL: HELLO / HI` - Greeting detected
- `ASL: Number 1 / Letter D` - Could be number 1 or letter D
- `ASL: I LOVE YOU` - The iconic "I Love You" sign
- `ASL: Open Hand (PLEASE/THANK YOU need motion)` - Hand shape detected, but motion needed for full interpretation

## Tips for Best Recognition

### Camera Setup

1. **Lighting**: Ensure good, even lighting on your hands
2. **Background**: Use a plain, contrasting background
3. **Distance**: Keep hands 1-2 feet from camera
4. **Position**: Center your hands in the camera view

### Signing Tips

1. **Clear Hand Shapes**: Make distinct, deliberate hand shapes
2. **Steady Hands**: Hold hand positions briefly for recognition
3. **Face Camera**: Keep palm orientation consistent
4. **One Hand**: Start with single-hand signs for better accuracy
5. **Practice**: Some signs may require practice for consistent recognition

## Understanding the Output

### Gesture Format

Each detected gesture is labeled with:

- `ASL:` prefix indicating it's an ASL sign
- Primary interpretation (e.g., "Number 2 / Letter V")
- Alternative meanings when applicable
- Notes about motion requirements

### Example Output

```
Hand 1 (Right) - Confidence: 0.95
🎯 Gesture: ASL: Number 2 / Letter V / Peace
🔢 Number: 2
✋ Fingers: Thumb ❌ Index Middle Ring ❌ Pinky ❌
```

## Vocabulary Categories

### Essential Communication (20+ signs)

Numbers, basic letters, greetings, common phrases

### Everyday Needs (15+ signs)

Food, bathroom, help, basic requests

### Emotions & States (8+ signs)

Happy, sad, excited, angry, etc.

### Complete ASL Alphabet

Static letters (A-Z) - some require motion

## Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

1. **Static Signs Only**: Motion-based signs show hand shape but need movement tracking
2. **Single Camera View**: Limited depth perception
3. **No Facial Expression**: Missing critical ASL component
4. **No Body Language**: Context and emphasis not captured
5. **One-Hand Optimized**: Two-hand signs may not be fully recognized

### Planned Enhancements

#### 1. Motion Tracking (High Priority)

- Track hand positions over multiple frames
- Calculate velocity and direction
- Recognize circular, linear, and complex motions
- **Impact**: Unlocks 30+ additional signs

#### 2. Facial Expression Recognition (Critical)

- Upgrade to MediaPipe Holistic
- Track 468 facial landmarks
- Detect eyebrow raises (questions)
- Recognize mouth shapes
- **Impact**: Essential for ASL grammar and context

#### 3. Body Pose Estimation

- Track 33 body landmarks
- Understand body orientation
- Capture emphasis and context
- **Impact**: Better sign disambiguation

#### 4. Two-Hand Coordination

- Simultaneous tracking of both hands
- Relative position analysis
- Complex two-hand signs
- **Impact**: Doubles vocabulary potential

#### 5. Contextual Understanding

- Sentence building from sign sequence
- Grammar rules application
- Context-aware interpretation
- **Impact**: Natural conversation flow

### Detection Process

1. **Camera Input**: Capture video frame
2. **Hand Detection**: MediaPipe identifies hands
3. **Landmark Extraction**: 21 points per hand detected
4. **Finger State Analysis**: Determine which fingers are extended
5. **Gesture Classification**: Match to ASL sign database
6. **Position Analysis**: Check hand location (head, chest, etc.)
7. **Orientation Check**: Determine palm direction
8. **Output Generation**: Display recognized sign

## Troubleshooting

### No Hands Detected

- ✅ Improve lighting
- ✅ Move closer to camera
- ✅ Ensure hands are fully visible
- ✅ Check camera permissions

### Incorrect Recognition

- ✅ Make clearer hand shapes
- ✅ Hold position longer
- ✅ Check finger positions match ASL standard
- ✅ Ensure proper palm orientation

### Low Confidence

- ✅ Improve lighting conditions
- ✅ Use plain background
- ✅ Make more distinct gestures
- ✅ Reduce hand movement

### Camera Issues

- ✅ Close other apps using camera
- ✅ Try different camera_id (0, 1, 2)
- ✅ Check camera drivers
- ✅ Restart application

## Contributing to ASL Vocabulary

### Adding New Signs

To add new ASL signs:

1. **Identify Hand Shape**: Determine finger configuration
2. **Add to Appropriate Interpreter**: Edit `gesture_interpreters.py`
3. **Define Detection Logic**: Add helper methods as needed
4. **Test Recognition**: Verify accuracy with multiple users
5. **Document**: Update this guide

Example:

```python
def _analyze_new_sign(self, landmarks: List[Dict]) -> str:
    """Detect specific ASL sign based on landmarks."""
    # Your detection logic here
    return "ASL: NEW SIGN"
```
