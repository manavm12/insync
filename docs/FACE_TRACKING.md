# Face Tracking for Enhanced ASL Recognition

## Overview

The ASL interpreter now includes **face tracking** capabilities using MediaPipe Holistic. This enables detection of gestures that require face reference points, such as signs that involve hand movement near the mouth, chest, or forehead.

## Why Face Tracking?

Many ASL signs are defined by hand position relative to the face:

- **THANK YOU**: Open palm moves from mouth downward
- **PLEASE**: Open palm makes circular motion on chest
- **SORRY**: Fist makes circular motion on chest
- **HELLO**: Open palm raised near forehead

Without face tracking, the system could only guess based on screen position. With face tracking, it knows exactly where your mouth, chin, and forehead are!

## Key Features

### Face Reference Points

The system tracks **4 key facial landmarks**:

1. **Nose Tip** - Primary face center reference
2. **Upper Lip (Mouth)** - For signs like THANK YOU
3. **Chin** - Chest area reference for PLEASE, SORRY
4. **Forehead** - Upper face reference for HELLO

### Distance-Based Detection

The system calculates the distance from your hand to each face point:

- **< 0.12** units from mouth → Detects THANK YOU
- **0.12-0.25** units from chin → Detects PLEASE
- **< 0.15** units from forehead → Detects HELLO

## Technical Implementation

### HolisticDetector Class

```python
from src.hand_landmarks import HolisticDetector

# Initialize with face tracking
detector = HolisticDetector(
    min_detection_confidence=0.5,
    min_tracking_confidence=0.5
)

# Detect hands + face
results = detector.detect_landmarks_image(frame)

# Results include:
# - hands_detected: Number of hands
# - hands: Hand landmark data
# - face_detected: Boolean
# - face_reference_point: Nose position
# - face_mouth_point: Mouth position
# - face_chin_point: Chin position
# - face_forehead_point: Forehead position
```

### Integration with Gesture Recognition

The gesture interpreters automatically use face data when available:

```python
from src.hand_landmarks import recognize_advanced_gestures

# Get gesture data (includes face points if detected)
gesture_data = detector.get_gesture_landmarks(frame)

# Recognition uses face reference automatically
gestures = recognize_advanced_gestures(gesture_data)

for gesture in gestures:
    print(f"Detected: {gesture['gesture']}")
    # Example output: "ASL: THANK YOU (near mouth, motion needed)"
```

## Usage

### Using the Enhanced Detector

The `RealTimeGestureDetector` now uses face tracking by default:

```python
from src.hand_landmarks import RealTimeGestureDetector

# Face tracking enabled by default
detector = RealTimeGestureDetector(camera_id=0, use_holistic=True)
detector.start_detection()

# Disable face tracking if needed
detector_no_face = RealTimeGestureDetector(camera_id=0, use_holistic=False)
```

### Testing Face Tracking

Run the test script to see face tracking in action:

```bash
python test_face_tracking.py
```

This shows:

- Face reference points drawn on screen (nose, mouth)
- Hand distance calculations
- Improved gesture detection

## Gestures Enhanced by Face Tracking

### ✅ Now Detectable

| Gesture       | Recognition Method                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **THANK YOU** | Open hand near mouth (< 0.12 units)         |
| **PLEASE**    | Open hand near chest/chin (0.12-0.25 units) |
| **HELLO**     | Open hand near forehead (< 0.15 units)      |
| **SORRY**     | Fist near chest/chin (< 0.20 units)         |

### 🔄 Still Need Motion Tracking

These gestures are partially detected (hand shape + position), but still need motion tracking for full recognition:

- THANK YOU - Needs downward motion
- PLEASE - Needs circular motion
- SORRY - Needs circular rubbing motion

## Performance Considerations

### Accuracy Improvements

With face tracking:

- **✅ Better position detection** - Knows exactly where face features are
- **✅ Person-independent** - Works for any face size/position
- **✅ Reduces false positives** - Hand must actually be near face

Without face tracking:

- **❌ Screen position guessing** - Assumes face is in certain area
- **❌ Size dependent** - May not work if you're far from camera
- **❌ More false positives** - Any hand at certain height triggers

### Computational Cost

Face tracking adds minimal overhead:

- **MediaPipe Holistic** is optimized for real-time performance
- Typically adds ~5-10ms per frame
- Runs smoothly on most modern computers

### Fallback Behavior

If face is not detected:

- System falls back to position-based detection
- Still recognizes gestures, just less accurately
- Warns user that face tracking would improve accuracy

## Configuration

### Confidence Thresholds

Adjust detection sensitivity:

```python
detector = HolisticDetector(
    min_detection_confidence=0.7,  # Higher = more strict
    min_tracking_confidence=0.5     # Lower = smoother tracking
)
```

### Distance Thresholds

Fine-tune in `gesture_interpreters.py`:

```python
# In FiveFingerInterpreter._analyze_open_hand()
if dist_to_mouth < 0.12:  # Adjust this threshold
    return "ASL: THANK YOU (near mouth, motion needed)"
```

## Visualization

The system draws face reference points on screen:

- **Yellow circle** at nose (primary reference)
- **Magenta circle** at mouth (THANK YOU reference)
- Labels show "NOSE" and "MOUTH"

This helps you:

- Verify face is being tracked
- See where reference points are
- Understand why certain gestures are detected

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Motion Tracking** (Next priority)

   - Track hand movement over time
   - Detect direction (up/down, circular)
   - Complete THANK YOU, PLEASE recognition

2. **Facial Expressions**

   - Use eyebrows for questions (ASL grammar)
   - Mouth shapes for certain signs
   - Head tilts for emphasis

3. **Body Pose**
   - Full body tracking
   - Two-hand signs requiring body reference
   - Torso orientation

## Troubleshooting

### Face Not Detected

**Problem**: System says "Face Tracked: NO"

**Solutions**:

- Ensure your face is visible and well-lit
- Move closer to camera
- Look towards camera (don't turn sideways)
- Check camera angle (face should be centered)

### Inaccurate Distance Detection

**Problem**: THANK YOU detected when hand isn't near mouth

**Solutions**:

- Adjust threshold in code (decrease from 0.12)
- Ensure face reference points are correctly tracked
- Check if face detection is stable (not jumping around)

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: System is slow or laggy

**Solutions**:

- Reduce camera resolution
- Increase `min_detection_confidence` to 0.7+
- Use `use_holistic=False` for faster but less accurate detection

## Example Output

With face tracking enabled:

```
Face Tracked: YES
Hands: 1
Hand 1: ASL: THANK YOU (near mouth, motion needed)
  (with face tracking)
```

Without face tracking:

```
Face Tracked: NO
Hands: 1
Hand 1: ASL: Open Hand (PLEASE/THANK YOU need motion)
```

Notice how face tracking provides **specific detection** vs generic "need motion"!
