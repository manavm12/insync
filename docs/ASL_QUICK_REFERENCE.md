## üí° Quick Tips

### For Best Recognition:

1. **Lighting**: Ensure bright, even lighting on your hands
2. **Background**: Use a plain, contrasting background
3. **Distance**: Keep hands 1-2 feet from camera
4. **Clarity**: Make distinct, deliberate hand shapes
5. **Hold**: Maintain hand position briefly for recognition
6. **Center**: Keep hands in center of camera view

### Hand Position Matters:

- **Upper region** (near face/head): HELLO, THANK YOU
- **Middle region** (chest level): PLEASE, SORRY
- **Palm orientation**: Important for many signs (check if palm faces towards or away from camera)

## üîç How to Read Output

### Example 1: Clear Recognition

```
üéØ Gesture: ASL: I LOVE YOU
‚úã Fingers: Thumb Index ‚ùå ‚ùå Pinky
```

**Meaning**: Successfully recognized "I LOVE YOU" sign

### Example 2: Hand Shape Only

```
üéØ Gesture: ASL: Open Hand (PLEASE/THANK YOU need motion)
```

**Meaning**: Hand shape detected, but motion tracking needed to distinguish between PLEASE and THANK YOU

### Example 3: Number Recognition

```
üéØ Gesture: ASL: Number 2 / Letter V / Peace
üî¢ Number: 2
```

**Meaning**: Could be number 2, letter V, or peace sign (all use same hand shape)
